# AI-driven-project-in-nature-and-food
AI-driven app that helps users identify edible plants and seasonal ingredients in nature. Users can take pictures to determine if a plant is edible or toxic, get recipe suggestions based on seasonal ingredients, and track the abundance of edible plants in their location within Sweden.

Which problems does your idea solve? How common is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic interesting or important? The app solves several issues: Many people want to forage and use wild plants, but are unsure which ones are edible or toxic. There is a need to know which ingredients are in season in different parts of Sweden to cook sustainable and local meals. Many are interested in sustainable cooking but lack knowledge of how to safely use local wild plants.

Personal Motivation: I’m passionate about combining sustainable technology with authenticity and nature. I want to make it easier for people to understand and appreciate Sweden’s flora while enabling them to cook sustainable meals using what grows around them and also tell stories about the ingredient - the star in the meal they´re about to prepare. 

How is it used?
How does the solution work? In what situations is it needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, and what needs should be considered? Users can: Take pictures of plants they find in nature to quickly determine if the plant is edible or toxic.Receive information about which plants and ingredients are in season at their specific location and time of year. Use a map to explore local, seasonal plants and get insights into how abundant a particular plant is in the area. Get recipe suggestions based on the plants they can forage.

Target Audience: Anyone interested in sustainable cooking, nature conservation, and local ingredients. The app is aimed at both beginners and experienced foragers of wild plants.
Data sources and AI methods. Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or use data collected by others? Data about plants and plant seasons are gathered from local plant databases, external sources like botanical books, and public resources about Swedish flora. AI is used to identify plants based on photos taken by users and to provide recommendations on when specific plants are in season, based on their geographic location and the current time of year.

Challenges: What does your project not solve? What limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this? The app cannot guarantee 100% accuracy when identifying plants through photos. There is a risk of misidentification, so users should always double-check if they are uncertain. Ethical considerations related to foraging: The app should make it clear that foraging should not take place in protected or restricted areas. The AI model should be continuously updated to improve plant identification accuracy and ensure the app provides as reliable information as possible.

What next? In the future, the app could: Integrate more external plant databases and foraging organizations to provide more accurate plant data. Develop a function that creates personalized recipes based on users' plant finds and dietary preferences. Implement a feature where users can suggest new plants to be added to the app’s database.

What would be needed to move forward? To further develop the app, expertise in plant biology, AI plant identification models, and more plant data would be required. Collaboration with sustainability and plant experts would provide further insights and data to improve the app's functionality.
